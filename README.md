The Electron Template

# To Run

Almost everything should have been automatically installed by the `lerna bootstrap`.

You'll have to run `yarn run firstinstall` after your first install or after a major git pull.

Run `yarn run dev` to begin the dev server.

# After installing dependencies

See if they have flow types with `npm run flow-typed`
